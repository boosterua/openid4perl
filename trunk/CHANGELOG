20061203: First public code drop, version 0.9.0.x

This is the first public release of the Perl OpenID package.  Currently,
the majority of the functionality required for a working RP is available,
but there is no RP implementation yet.  See TODO for a full list of items
we plan to add in the near future.

Packages complete in this release:
 - Net::OpenID2::Association
 - Net::OpenID2::Consumer (except for the RP)
 - Net::OpenID2::Discovery
 - Net::OpenID2::Message (nearly)
 - Net::OpenID2::Util

... and of course all tests.
